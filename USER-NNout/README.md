# Calculate Neural Network using symmetry function

<p align="justify"> 
  
  ## Input
  
  In this directory, we have a compute command that can calculate the Neural Network using symmetry function. 
  In addition to run file, you need INPUT.dat. Check the sample code carefully and run the command. 

```bash
    compute  ID  groupID  nnoutgen/atom  center_atom_type  total_symmetry_function_number  
```
This is the sample line 
```bash
    compute CNN  all nnoutgen/atom 9 24 
```

## Output

After you run the code, you will get g2g3output-0.dat. 
This file contains neural network output results for each molecule.
