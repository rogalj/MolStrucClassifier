In the data file I have the data file with the following format. 

atom style: full2
atom ID, molID, atom_type, charge, sym_type, x, y, z
1 1 5 -0.326615 1 2.785 7.001 1.945



When you make the sym_type, you need to have a unique number for the one you use for the symmetry function calculation. For others, you can have the same number. In this example, I used 0 for atoms that I won't use for the calculation.
