test output       output.dat    ! name of file for test output
test error        error.dat     ! name of file for test error result (misclassified)


weights input     weights_old.dat   ! name of file containing previous weights
weights output    weights.dat   ! name of file to print new fitted weights

! FORMAT OF THE INPUT FILE:
! the first 3 lines are simply read in as string
! the rest is parsed and identified over a string
! !IMPORTANT!  The first 16 (!) characters are reserved for the key word!!
! after this different parameter in one line must be separated by at least on space
! (lines starting with '#' are read as text string and just printed out) <- just comments now
! lines starting with '!' are comments
